    My name is Gabriella Izversky. I am a public relation major and currently undecided in business, interested in working on the business side of an entertainment or makeup company. I am excel certified, and am experienced with different social media platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and LinkedIn. I am also bilingual, my second language being Russian. I enjoy spending time with my friends and family, hanging out with my dog, and working out. I love to watch TV, some of my favorite shows being Lost, Only Murders in the Building, and Friends. I also have a twin sister who is my best friend. I love to shop and try new foods and restaurants as well.
