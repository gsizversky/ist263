   <div><p>London was the first place that my family took me in Europe. It is a great place to take a younger child there or anyone who has not yet been out of the US as they speak English. I fell in love with London and here is why:<br>
   The changing of the guards is something you do not want to miss! Guards march to the front of Buckingham palace with a band and horses. Also, you can look at the palace while watching. This is an experience that you won't get to have anywhere else. This happens every other day at eleven AM.</p></div>

    <div class="towerwrite"><p>The tower Bridge is also a great spot to visit when in London. Walk along the bridge and see beautiful views of London. It is a religious building and is beautiful inside. It is open Monday through Saturday 9:30 am to 3:30 pm. This a historic building that must be on your to-do list when you go.</p></div>

   <div><p>When going to London you should take a tour of Westminster Abbey. It is a religious building and is beautiful inside. It is open Monday through Saturday 9:30 am to 3:30 pm. This a historic building that must be on your to-do list when you go.</p></div>

    <p>There are some great restaurants in London that are perfect for dinners. Sexy Fish is a great restaurant that has Asian inspired cuisine. It has a great ambiance and service, and of course the food is delicious. 
        You also do not want to miss out on a High Tea experience. Enjoy some tea or coffee with small finger sandwiches and desserts. Fortnum and Mason has a fantastic high tea experience at the Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon that I loved when I visited!
